# gameplay description
In Domino, the gameplay is immersive in nature, providing players with an exciting virtual Domino game experience. After starting the game through the main menu, players are presented with a virtual field of dominoes. They can take turns making moves, trying to get rid of their dominoes and win. The results of the game are displayed, allowing you to see which player has won or is declared a draw.

During gameplay, users can use an intuitive interface to make moves, as well as the ability to view Domino game rules or scoreboards directly from the main menu. The integration of sound effects adds extra interactivity to the game, emphasizing every step and creating an immersive atmosphere. Domino is not just a game, but a whole virtual world of tabletop entertainment fun. ðŸŽ®âœ¨
